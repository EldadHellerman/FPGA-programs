# FPGA Programs 
These are a collection of progams meant to run on a Tang Nano 9k board.
I'm using the software provided by GOWIN to do everything. It's pretty decent and very beginner friendly.

Here is a list of the different programs:

0. empty template
1. LED blink
2. Counting on a seven segment display

With more to come...
